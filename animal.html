            <span class="text"><span class="basliq">Loyalty</span>
          Not sure if there are any other beings that are more loyal, 
          but dogs must be on the top of the list. I noticed dogs are very loyal, 
          and I think it’s because of the combination of characteristics that make up 
          who they are. Not they don’t need a wedding wrong to go through thick and thin, 
          dogs just want your love. And in exchange, they will give you loyalty and much more.</span>

                        Not only are dogs simple minded but they are above all selfless creatures. 
                        They don’t really have any special demands. They just satisfied with the basics.
                        They never expect something in return or a favor. 
                        Never take away from you for their own benefit.</span>

                                    Dogs don’t care if you are black, Arab, jewish, if you have any physically 
                                    or mental disabilities. They don’t care if you have money, if you are good looking or even if you are smart. They just learn to love you for who you are. Even when things are perfect, even if you neglect them, they are just unconditional lovers. 
                                    They will sense your pain and feel pain with you.</span>

                                One can’t deny, dogs are simple. Most of their day consists of: eating, 
                                playing and sleeping. But they also spend most of their day trying to make
                                you (their owner) happy. They appreciate the simple things in life and 
                                never ask for more (maybe more food). I wish people including myself would 
                                just appreciate the simple things in life. Instead we want more, 
                                more of what the others have, more money or more clothes/jewelry.</span>
